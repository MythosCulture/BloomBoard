# ScarabRP
Welcome to my app! This is a Springboot project using Thymeleaf and Postgresql.  
Scarab RP is a website for collaboratively building stories by way of roleplaying with a focus on anonymity. Users can create anonymous posts called prompts or answer prompts created by other users to join a private chat.

#### What is Roleplaying?
Roleplaying is a creative activity where participants assume the roles of fictional characters and interact within a shared narrative. It's like stepping into the shoes of your favorite characters and contributing to an evolving storyline.
