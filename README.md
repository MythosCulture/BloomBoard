# ScarabRP
Welcome to my app! This is a Spring Boot project using Thymeleaf and Postgresql.

Scarab RP is a website for collaboratively building stories by way of roleplaying with a focus on anonymity. Users can create anonymous posts called prompts or answer prompts created by other users to join a private chat.

## Usage

To access the application, visit the following URL: [https://scarabrp.herokuapp.com/](https://scarabrp.herokuapp.com/)
Note: The server may be down occassionally when no one has accessed it in a while. Wait a minute then try again if the page doesn't initally load.
